## **Image Similarity Search index using long term memory of AI**

Similar image search using cosine similarity index relies on the powerful capabilities of AI's long-term memory. This approach leverages the inherent ability of AI models to remember and extract meaningful features from images, allowing for efficient and accurate image retrieval.

At the core of this technique lies the concept of cosine similarity, which measures the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. In the context of image search, images are represented as high-dimensional feature vectors extracted from their respective visual representations. These feature vectors capture intricate details such as edges, textures, shapes, and colors, enabling the AI model to understand the visual content of the images.

To perform a similar image search, the AI model first encodes the input query image into its corresponding feature vector. This vector is then compared with the feature vectors of the images stored in its long-term memory. By calculating the cosine similarity index between the query vector and the vectors of the stored images, the AI model can determine the similarity between the query image and the images in its memory.

## Inspiration
In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation methods,  and inadequate plant protection techniques. Crop yields are affected at large scale due  to spread of unchecked diseases. The spread of these diseases is similar to the spreading of cancer in human body. But, unlike cancer these diseases can be identified at early stages through plant phenotyping traits analysis.

## What it does
The **Crop disease detection and precautions recommendation** project utilizes cutting-edge technology to assist farmers in identifying crop diseases and providing personalized recommendations for disease prevention and treatment. By leveraging the power of machine learning and OpenAi, this project aims to empower farmers to make informed decisions and protect their crops' health.

## How we built it
To build this project, we employed several key technologies and methodologies. We started by training a deep learning model called SqueezeNet1_1 using a vast collection of crop disease images. This model was trained to accurately classify and detect different diseases based on the visual features of crop leaves.

Next, we utilized Pinecone, a vector database service, to convert the trained **SqueezeNet1_1 model** into vector embeddings. These embeddings represented unique representations of the images, allowing for efficient and fast retrieval of similar images or disease classifications.

To complement the image-based disease detection, we incorporated OpenAI's text generation capabilities. For each detected disease, we utilized text generation algorithms to provide detailed and actionable precautions and recommendations.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating Pinecone for vector embedding storage presented its own set of challenges. We had to carefully design and optimize the retrieval system to provide fast and accurate disease identification based on the vector embeddings.

Integrating the capabilities of uploading the images as base64 (for data security) and converting it again for analysis.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the challenges faced, we're proud to have developed a comprehensive crop disease detection and precaution recommendation system.  This personalized guidance provides farmers with actionable steps to protect their crops, ultimately leading to better crop health and increased yields.

## What we learned
Developing this project provided us with valuable insights into the intersection of machine learning, text generation, and agriculture. We gained a deeper understanding of training deep learning models for image classification and the challenges associated with real-world disease detection scenarios. We also learned how to leverage text generation models to generate context-specific recommendations based on disease classifications.

## What's next for Crop disease detection and precautions recommendation
Looking ahead, we aim to continuously improve and expand the capabilities of this project. We plan to incorporate additional crop varieties and expand the dataset to enhance the model's versatility and accuracy. Additionally, we will explore ways to enhance the text generation component by integrating feedback mechanisms and leveraging user interactions to improve the quality and relevance of the recommendations.
